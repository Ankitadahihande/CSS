Bromelain, the digestive enzyme in pineapple, has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. This helps when you have
 an infection, like sinusitis, or an injury, like a sprain or burn. It also offsets the joint pain of osteoarthritis. 
 The vitamin C in pineapple juice also keeps inflammation levels low.</p>
